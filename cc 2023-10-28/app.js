// DESCRIPTION:
// Terminal game turn function
// You are creating a text-based terminal version of your favorite board game. In the board game, each turn has six steps that must happen in this order: roll the dice, move, combat, get coins, buy more health, and print status.

// You are using a library (Game.Logic in C#) that already has the functions below. Create a function named doTurn/DoTurn/do_turn that calls the functions in the proper order as described in the paragraph above.

// - combat
// - buyHealth
// - getCoins
// - printStatus
// - rollDice
// - move




//prep 
//parameter 
//return function calls in a proper order
//example roll the dice, move, combat, get coins, buy more health, and print status.


function doTurn () {
    // Call functions here
    log = ['rollDice','move','combat','getCoins','buyHealth','printStatus'];


  }
  
//   function doTurn () {
//     var actions = [rollDice, move, combat, getCoins, buyHealth, printStatus];
//     actions.forEach(e => e());
//   }
