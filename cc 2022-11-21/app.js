// Your task is to remove all consecutive duplicate words from a string, leaving only first words entries. For example:

// "alpha beta beta gamma gamma gamma delta alpha beta beta gamma gamma gamma delta"

// --> "alpha beta gamma delta alpha beta gamma delta"


//Prep Parameters Return Example Psuedo


const removeConsecutiveDuplicates = s => // your perfect code...

//must check first letter of first word, with first letter of second word

if(s.charAt[])
//if this same, continue to next letter
//when out of matching letters, words are the same, and second word should removed, leaving only one word from matching.
